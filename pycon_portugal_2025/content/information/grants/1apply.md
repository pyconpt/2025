## Apply Now

Lastly, we know that some of you reading this will doubt whether it's right and proper for you to apply for a grant. That's why we want to stress:

* Have you already attended a conference in the past? That's OK.
* Already received a grant in the past? Still OK.
* Don't have much experience with Python? That's OK, too.
* Don't want to take money away from someone else? Really, it's OK, everyone says that!
* Don't feel like you deserve this? That's also OK: you do.

With our limited funds, we can't promise you will receive a grant, but if you're not sure, **we encourage you to apply**. If you're uncomfortable with other people knowing you received a grant, you don't have to tell them - our policy is to never publicly identify grant applicants or recipients without their explicit permission.
